# React Custom Hooks Collection
This is a collection of react custom hooks. I'll update this list if there's any new ones. 

All the hooks are inside CustomHooks folder. 

## Custom Hook List (links below will direct you to the corresponding hook.js file)
- [useDarkMode](./CustomHooks/useDarkMode.js): includes hook, example Navbar component that uses this hook and CSS that relates to this hook
- [useForm](./CustomHooks/useForm.js): this hook can handle input change and form submission
- [useLocalStorage](./CustomHooks/useLocalStorage.js): can be used with other hooks
- [useMusicPlayer](./CustomHooks/useMusicPlayer.js)
- [useAxios](./CustomHooks/useAxios.js): this hook works together with useLocalStorage hook and axios for data fetching
